}                             (I changed the language used in the code for the "System.out.println" and I also changed it for "System.out.print". 
                              The major change for this code was that I capped the value of numbers it can do. The way I have the code now is only numbers
                              0-10). If you enter a number not familiar it should say "Please enter a value between 1-10).)
